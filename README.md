Github intro here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
+ For git practice (and software hygiene) develop your pipelines in your own branches! Also start your work session by fetching/pulling any upstream changes. Try to avoid directly committing to master unless updating `.gitignore` or READMEs
+ commit often and leave lots of messages!

For scratch files, create a directory anywhere called `scratch/`. This will not be synced.
